# API documentation writing-sample

## Introduction

This repository contains a sample REST API documentation project focused on an IoT Device Management API in the Software Networking domain. It demonstrates how to design and document a secure, scalable API used to register, monitor, update, and decommission IoT devices across distributed edge networks.

The documentation is structured to reflect real-world enterprise standards and includes:
	•	A clear overview of API functionality
	•	Authentication and token management details (OAuth 2.0)
	•	Endpoint definitions with example requests and responses
	•	Error handling with HTTP status codes
	•	Code samples in cURL and Python
	•	Usage guidance for developers and integration teams

This sample is designed as part of a professional technical writing work sample and showcases how user-focused API documentation should be written for teams working in backend, DevOps, IoT, or cloud-based deployments.

## Notes:

The following token request sample is based on the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant flow. This method is widely used to obtain access tokens for server-to-server communication, where user login is not required.

POST /token
Host: auth.iotnetwork.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=client_credentials&
client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&
client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET

**Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

Q1: What is POST /token?
•	It is the standard token endpoint in most OAuth 2.0-compliant systems.
•	This endpoint is responsible for issuing access tokens when valid credentials are provided.

Q2: Why is the host set to auth.iotnetwork.com?
•	This represents a dedicated authorization server, a common pattern in enterprise-grade APIs.
•	Many APIs separate authentication (token issuing) from resource access (API endpoints), ensuring better security and scalability.

Q3: Why is Content-Type set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded?
•	This is the required content type for OAuth 2.0 token requests as per the OAuth 2.0 specification (RFC 6749).

Q4: Why use grant_type=client_credentials?
•	It is the appropriate OAuth 2.0 grant type when the API is accessed without user involvement (e.g., backend services, IoT systems).

Q5: Why are client_id and client_secret needed?
•	These are used to authenticate the calling client (your app or service) with the authorization server.
•	They work similarly to a username and password, validating the identity of the application.
